# About
I am Will Rosenberg - a first year PhD student at Arizona State University (ASU), working in the SEFCOM lab under Yan Shoshitaishvili. I enjoy dissecting technologies at their most basic level, which has drawn me towards the field of computer security. My research focuses on software and systems security with an emphasis on automated program analysis. 

I am a big fan of Capture the Flag (CTF) hacking competitions and compete under the pseudonym "mowteam". I focus on pwn and crypto challenges with a slowly emerging love for rev. I previously competed with [b34r5hell](https://wustl-bearshell.github.io) and was captain from 2023-2025.

More to come soon...
