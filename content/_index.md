# About
I am Will Rosenberg - a first year PhD student at Arizona State University (ASU), working in the SEFCOM lab advised by Professor Yan Shoshitaishvili. I also work closely with Professor Ruoyu (Fish) Wang, Professor Adam Doupé, and Professor Tiffany Bao.

I enjoy dissecting technologies at their most basic level, which has drawn me towards the field of computer security. My research focuses on software security with an emphasis on automated program analysis and kernel security. 

I am a big fan of Capture the Flag (CTF) hacking competitions and compete under the pseudonym "mowteam". I focus on pwn and crypto challenges with a slowly emerging love for rev. I previously competed with [b34r5hell](https://wustl-bearshell.github.io) and was a captain from 2023-2025.

I also contribute to the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search.

More to come soon...
